# SynthID
SynthID-style encoder/decoder for robust video watermarking: extract frames, embed mid-freq DCT noise patterns, and rebuild the video. Decoder performs frequency analysis, noise correlation, heatmap visualization, and bit recovery. Marker survives cropping, compression, filters, resizing, screenshots, and screen recordings.
